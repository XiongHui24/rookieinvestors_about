      Hello everyone! I am Xiong Hui, An experienced banker in trade finance, passionate in investment and equity analysis. I am open to jobs in equity
      analyst or investment banking or any other related opportunity. I am eager to learn and a fast learner. I like challenges thus came out with the idea to built up my first webpage.
      On top of that, I am sensitive to figures with decent analytic skills. While busying with my daily job, I also did some self-learning in Python and HTML, hoping one day
      I am able to combine investment and data science. During my free time, I like to play basketball, listening to music and 
      watch movies. I also love to spend some time reading financial reports and study for CFA Exam Level I.

      <li><b>SPM (2011)</b>
        <ul>
          <li class="w3-justify">I am a Science stream student and I took SPM in year 2011. I have taken 10 subjects in SPM including
            Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Mandrin. My result for SPM is 6 A+, 3A and 1A-.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>STPM (2012-2013)</b>
        <ul>
          <li class="w3-justify">I have continued to further my studies in Form 6 in year 2012. The reason I went for Form 6 is
            to secure a seat in any public university in Malaysia. I have continued as a Science stream
            student and took Physics instead of Biology, knowing that I am not really interested in Biology.
            I took STPM in year 2013 and my final result for STPM is 3.75/4.00. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Bachelor Degree (2014-2017)</b>
        <ul>
          <li class="w3-justify">After my STPM, I had successfully secured a seat in <em>Faculty of Science, The National University of Malaysia (UKM)</em>.
              My goal is to study Actuarial Science however I end up enrolled in Statistics. Throughout my uni life, I have
              participated in various competitions and conferences regarding data science and big data and this has built up my
              interest in programming and data analytics. Besides, I am also active in sports and joining committees. I have 
              represented my kolej to participate in basketball competition and won second place as a team. I have successfully
              graduated in 2017 with a pointer of 3.69/4.00. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Masters Degree (2017-2018)</b>
        <ul>
          <li class="w3-justify">As a fresh graduate, I did not step into the society right after my graduation. Instead, I have
              enrolled in <em>Masters Degree in Business Administration</em> in UKM as well. I was inspired by one of the
              management in the company where I completed my internship. My senior has taught me how important it is
              to have leadership quality, financial literacy and business management skills. Therefore, I have made
              my mind to study for another year in UKM. It was the cornerstone in developing my interest towards
              business and investment. I majored in finance and had the chance to learn from Datin Zameema Banu,
              one of the trainers from RAM Holdings Sdn Bhd and guided us in the Certificate in the Malaysian
              Capital Market. In 2018, I graduated from Masters Degree with a pointer of 3.82/4.00.  </li>
